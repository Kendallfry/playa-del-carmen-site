          <h2>Xcaret and Xplore Amusement Parks</h2>
          <p>
            These 2 amusement parks are truly a sight to see! Xcaret offers a more family-friendly approach with snorkeling,
            animal observation, swimming with dolphins, and an epic show on the history of Mexico full of music, dancing and
            even fire!
          </p>

          <p>
            Xplore park is an attraction you'll never forget! With its more than 10 gigantic zip lines, Xplore also holds a
            vast amount of the natural phenomenon native Mexicans refer to as cenotes. A cenote is a naturally formed sinkhole,
            that have been turned into some of the most beautiful swimming holes you can imagine.

          <h2>Chitzen Itza</h2>
          <p>
            Chichén Itzá is one of the most awe-inspiring ancient cities in the world. It offers a vast amount of Mayan
            architecture hidden in the jungles of Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula. At the heart of Itza El Castillo. El Castillo is a
            pyramid built with such precision that it creates a shadowy serpent during the spring and fall equinoxes. This is
            truly fascinating as the Mayan people of this area worshiped the snake God Kukulkan. Many sculptures surrounding the
            area are inspired by the snake God. While in Itza you will be able to walk among sacred temples, explore intricate
            carvings, and stand in the same spot where ancient astronomers once mapped the stars. Chichén Itzá offers an
            experience that feels like stepping into another world.

          <h2>Mayan ruins of Tulum</h2>
          <p>
            The Tulum ruins are a breathtaking blend of history and scenery — an ancient Mayan city perched on a cliff
            overlooking the deep blue Caribbean Sea. Once a bustling port and fortress, its stone temples and ocean views offer a
            powerful glimpse into the past. With its unique coastal setting and rich cultural legacy, Tulum is the perfect place
            to explore ancient wonders and enjoy paradise at the same time.
