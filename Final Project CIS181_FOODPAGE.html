				vast amount of Mayan architecture hidden in the jungles of Mexico’s Yucatán 
				Peninsula. At the heart of Itza El Castillo. El Castillo is a pyramid built with such precision 
				that it creates a shadowy serpent during the spring and fall equinoxes. This is truly fascinating as the Mayan 
				people of this area worshiped the snake God Kukulkan. Many sculture surounding the are
				inspired by the snake God. 	White in Itza you will be able to walk among sacred 
				temples, explore intricate carvings, and stand in the same spot where ancient astronomers
