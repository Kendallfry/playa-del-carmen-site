      <h2>About the Designer.</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Kendall Fry. I am 32 years old and from the city of Chicago. I am currently a chemical lead for Ecolab and I am currently enrolled at Truman
        so I can get over to the IT side of my company. With the end of the summmer semester I will be 40% finished with my Associates Degree in computer
        sciece and will pursue a bahcelors degree after.
      </p>

        I honeslty enjoy the process of learing something new. This has made the experience of learning HTML, CSS and Javaascript fin and exciting for me.
        I will admit though that learning programming languages is similar to learning an actaul new language. This has made the class difficult at times.
        Though I feel like learning is the best when it's a challenge.
      </p>

        I truly love travelling and Playa Del Carmen was one of my favorite trips. The food and weather were completely amazing. The american dollar really
        stretches down there as well.
